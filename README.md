## Ember Dev

Ember Dev is set of test helpers written in ES6. It is based on the
same goal as the original ember-dev Ruby Gem: Unifying the tooling
between Ember and Ember-Data.

### Thanks

A big thanks to [CrowdStrike](http://www.crowdstrike.com/) for
supporting the initial implementation of ember-dev as a Ruby Gem.
