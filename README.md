## Ember Dev

Ember Dev is a gem for developing Ember.js packages. The initial goal is
to share tooling between Ember Core and Ember Data. The second goal is
to provide tooling for developers seeking to develop packages for Ember.
(This is not intended to be a tool for developing Ember applications.)

### Use

Unfortunately, this project isn't yet in a state where we can recommend
public use. We're lacking a few important features such as generators
that are required for general ease of use. If you're interested in
helping improve this project, please let us know and we can give you
some direction of where help is needed.

### Thanks

A big thanks to [CrowdStrike](http://www.crowdstrike.com/) for
supporting the initial work necessary to extract this code from the
Ember repos.
