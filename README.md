## Ember Dev

Ember Dev is a gem for developing Ember.js packages. The initial goal is
to share tooling between Ember Core and Ember Data. The second goal is
to provide tooling for developers seeking to develop packages for Ember.
(This is not intended to be a tool for developing Ember applications.)

### Thanks

A big thanks to [CrowdStrike](http://www.crowdstrike.com/) for
supporting the initial work necessary to extract this code from the
Ember repos.
